Make sure the required packages are installed. You should be good to go.

Things to keep in mind:
1. I wrote this code while my three-year-old cousin sat and played video games in my lap.  If I made a mistake please feel free to reach out! :) 
2. I found the number of days between each submission and January 1st, then computed descriptive statistics (mean, outliers removed) to "estimate" when
you will get an admission decision.  Because of outliers, false submissions, and coder stupidity, please do not depend on these results and instead reach out to your department if you are worried.
3. Please feel free to email me if you notice any issues.  Thank you!
